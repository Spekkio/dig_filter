This is a simulator for a RC circuit, you can generate a square wave with ringing edges also.

To generate a square wav./sim -type square -timestamp -t 0.00001 -limit 0.1 -freq 100e with ringing edges

./sim -type square -timestamp -t 0.00001 -limit 0.1 -freq 100

-type square
tell the simulator to make a square wave

-timestamp
tell the simulator to print out the timestamps, used for plotting

-t 0.00001
tell the simulator to have the timestep of 0.00001 seconds

-limit 0.1
stop simulating at 0.1 seconds

-freq
the square wave will have the frequency 100 Hz


We can use a pipe to transfer a square wave to a RC filter

./sim -type square -t 0.00001 -limit 0.5 -freq 100 | ./sim -type rc -timestamp -r 10000 -c 0.000047 > test.txt

remove -timestamp from the -type square side, and put it in the last pipe. otherwise we get errors.
Now we can store the information in test.txt and plot it with gnuplot

gnuplot
> plot 'test.txt' with lines
